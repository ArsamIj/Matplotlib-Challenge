# Matplotlib-Challenge
Matplotlib-Challenge

Matplotlib is an excellent challenge to incorporate visuals into our understanding of python and pandas.
In this activity, we were given access to the complete data from a recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

After reveiwing the data and performing the required calculations, the following observations are made:
A) Size/amount of tumor volume in a given sample of mice increase as the weight is increased per test.
B) Capomulin drug regimen has shown significant decrease in tumor volume over the given timepoints in one single mouse tested, and proves to be the case in other mice as well.
C) Few to none outliers are recorded in the data showing that data is consistent.
D) Capomulin and Ramicane were the drugs of choice of a larger sample than other drug regimens.
